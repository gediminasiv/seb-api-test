Fresh Symfony
=============

I am developing a lot of my web applications in Symfony. And I noticed, that I waste a shitload of time configuring Symfony all over and over again.

The default skeleton app that Symfony developers provide is crap. My skeleton app is a killer as it has:

* FOSUser installed and configured.
* Asset manager, that depends on bower with installed following assets:
    * Bootstrap 4.
    * jQuery.
* Basic Bootstrap template.
* Tests (I think that most of the tests are avoided because they are not used from the start).

Also, non-retarded file system (at least to my opinion).
